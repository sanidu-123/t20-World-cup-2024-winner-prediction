## Methodology
The teams have been divided into four groups by the International Cricket Council (ICC) regulations. Each group comprises five teams, making twenty teams participating in the tournament. During the tournament's initial phase, each team competes against the other four teams in their group. This stage is crucial as it determines the progression of the teams to the next phase.

Upon the matches' completion within the groups, two teams from each group, those with the most wins, are selected. This selection process results in a total of eight teams. These ‘Super 8’ teams then proceed to the tournament's next stage, marking the commencement of the more competitive phase. The performance of the teams in this stage will determine their journey towards the championship.

This structure ensures a fair and exciting competition, providing each team with an equal opportunity to showcase their skills and strategies. It also enhances the spectator experience by offering matches between different teams.
